- CSS Grid

### What I learned

With this project I have learned to link a Github repository with my computer and publish it on Github pages.

Coding a page from a mockup has also been an interesting and surely very useful exercise.

### Continued development

Responsive design and coding from a "mobile first" perspective.


### Useful resources
